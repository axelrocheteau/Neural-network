    "When a model developed for one task is reused to work on a second task  \n",
    "#### 2 approaches:\n",
    "- Feature extraction: start with a pretrained model and only update the final layer weights from which we derive predictions\n",
    "- Fine tuning: start with a pretrained model and update all of the modelâ€™s parameters for our new task\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize the pretrained model\n",
    "2. Reshape the final layer(s) to have the same number of outputs as the number of classes in the new dataset\n",
    "3. Define for the optimization algorithm which parameters we want to update during training\n",
    "4. Run the training step"
