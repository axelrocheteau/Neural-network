# Neural-network

## Project

The main goal of this project is to recognize the sport displayed by an image.
For this task we downloaded data from 22 differents sports and reduce them to only 15 sports.
which are : 
badminton,
baseball,
basketball,
boxing,
cricket,
football,
gymnastics,
hockey,
swimming,
table_tennis,
tennis,
volleyball,
weight_lifting,
wrestling,
wwe

To succeed in this task we used transfer learning method from model trained on imagenet.
The project is divided into three main parts. Each part is showing the influence of a certain parameter on the results.
Notice that in this project, du to a lack of computer power, hyperparameters are not optimized.
The first part treat about diffrent pre-trained moodels. The second part tackle the quality of the input image (size and blur).
